# Human Services Data Specification v1.0

## Introduction

Government entities, community organizations, and businesses often face difficulty obtaining timely and correct data about health and human services. The Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) facilitates the open exchange and use of data among these stakeholders.  All organizations that provide services or referrals, as well as entities that consume or distribute digital human services information, are invited to publish their data in this format. 

The Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) is an exchange format for publishing machine readable data about health and social services, their locations, and the organizations that provide them. For the purposes of this specification, human services are broadly defined, ranging from food assistance to job training to health care. HSDS is meant to complement –not replace– existing storage formats. 

The development of HSDS has to date taken place within Code for America through support by the Knight Foundation and Google.org. Learn more about Code for America’s work on  data standards [here](http://www.codeforamerica.org/cities/data-standards-faq/).

## Related Standards

### AIRS Standards

The AIRS Standards defines expected practices within an information and referral (I&R) program and best practices to meet the needs of their community. According to [AIRS Standards and Quality Indicators for Professional Information and Referra](http://www.airs.org/files/public/AIRS_Standards_7_Final.pdf)l:

"The Standards address all aspects of an I&R operation. They define the information and referral process in concrete terms; establish criteria for database development; mandate support for community planning activities; incorporate a broad view of collaboration at the local, state or provincial, regional and national levels; include provisions for the socially responsible use of technology; and describe the role of information and referral services in times of disaster. “

The Resource Database Standard of the AIRS Standards is pertinent to the Human Services Data Specification. As described in the AIRS Standards and Quality Indicators publication, the Resource Database Standard:

"The Resource Database standards require that the I&R service develop, maintain, use and disseminate an accurate, up-to-date resource database that contains information about available community resources including details about the services they provide and the conditions under which services are available. The database includes resources that support the inquirer’s right to accurate, consistent, comprehensive and unbiased information and the ability of the I&R service to be a non-partisan, non-ideological and impartial information source for available nonprofit, government and for-profit services that meet the organization’s inclusion/exclusion criteria. The database is maintained by trained resource specialists." 

### schema.org for Public Civic Services

[Public Civil Services](http://www.w3.org/wiki/images/0/03/Services_for_schema.org_%28DRAFT_2013-06-27%29.pdf) is a [W3C proposal](http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/CivicServices) by the Google.org Social Impact team that extends the Schema.org schemas to better support the description of public civic services.

It is a new vocabulary, similar to the European Commission ISA Core Public Service vocabulary. Its purpose is to improve search engines’ understanding of these services. The schema will provide "*enough information to determine the service, the area covered by the service, and relevant information for using the service*." 

### Open Eligibility

[Open Eligibility](http://openeligibility.org/) is a "*simple way to categorize human services and human situations*." It uses common categories for quickly finding human services for people in need, service providers and navigators. It takes a different approach than the AIRS standards by grouping similar services and repeatedly and empirically testing the categories. Open Eligibility explains their taxonomy as:

> "Every provider administers at least one program. Every program provides at least one client-facing service. And every service is represented with a service tag. Our taxonomy is a categorization of those service tags."

### National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)

NIEM is the National Information Exchange Model. It is an interagency initiative to create a national-level interoperable information sharing and data exchange. The NIEM project began in 2005 as a joint venture between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The NIEM uses both the Global Justice XML Data Model (GJXDM) reference model and the GJXDM XML-based framework and support infrastructure.

NIEM consists of a  collection of data components organized in multiple kinds of XML Schema that are classified into broad categories. Of interest to the Human Services Data  Standard are the NIEM Core Components. There are two types of NIEM Core components:

1. Universal components such as Person, Date, Location etc., that are relevant and understood across all domains
2. Common components such as LocationStateUSPostalServiceCode, LocationStateCanadianProvinceCode etc., that are relevant and understood across two or more domains

The schema for the core components is available from [niem.gov](http://release.niem.gov/niem/niem-core/2.0/niem-core.xsd).

## Use Cases

### Help Seeker

Help seekers  (i.e. patients, clients, consumers, victims, survivors, etc.) have a need (or multiple needs) that can be addressed by services in their community. To find services, help seekers must receive accurate, relevant, and easily understandable information about services which they can access and for which they are eligible. 

Help seekers may not be capable of articulating the addressable aspect of their needs. They may have limited media literacy and limited access to technology. They may not know about the existence of relevant services, let alone the ‘correct’ terms to describe those services. They may have difficulty processing and/or trusting information. They may struggle with anticipated or actual stigmatization for seeking help. Incorrect information can cost help-seekers time, money, or even conceivably lives. 

Help seekers might currently look for help by searching the Internet or turning to a trusted community anchor like a library, school, or religious institution. They might talk to a service provider ("referrer") who can help identify addressable needs (through some screening process) and provide them with actionable information about services.

*As a help-seeker, I want to find services that meet my needs.*

### Referrer

A Referrer is the person who engages directly with a help-seeker (often face-to-face) and helps them find relevant and accessible services. A ‘referrer’ is usually (but not always) a professional or a volunteer who is working for an organization that itself provides as a service to its community (i.e. case manager, social worker, health worker, EMT, patient intake, librarian, teacher, etc.). Referrers are typically the primary users of resource directory information systems. 

Referrers require:

1. accurate information,
2. the service’s relevance (is the client eligible), and 
3. the quality of the service. 

Referrers commonly interact with help seekers using a structured workflow that includes a screening process to identify important attributes of the help-seeker’s situation. Referrers match information gathered from the help-seeker to accessible and relevant services. 

*As a referrer (aka service provider, etc), I want to provide relevant and accurate information about services.*

### Researcher

A Researcher uses service directory data, in synthesis with other kinds of data, for the purpose of understanding community health, predicting future needs, identifying funding gaps, and other kinds of analysis. Such a role is often played by funders, policymakers, planners, or community leaders.

Researchers study the effectiveness of *programs*, which may not be specific services but rather a set of services bundled through a funding stream and around a common mission. Researchers seek accountability for the performance of the health, human, and social service system overall. They want their work to make this data useful for system-level decision-making. Researchers need reliably structured data, from across institutional and jurisdictional boundaries, that can be readily ‘mashed up’ with other kinds of data (census, funding, etc). 

*As a researcher, I need data in raw formats over a specific time period and meaningful context for service information so that I can perform efforts-to-outcomes and population-level analysis.*

### Data Administrator

A Data Administrator is responsible for  information systems that are a compilation of directories. Data administrators produce and maintain information; tasks include updating records, maintaining naming conventions, running reports, designing mechanisms for retrieval and delivery, etc. They may be responsible for reporting directly to funders and government agencies. These responsibilities are sometimes shared among several roles in an organization. 

*As a data administrator, I want a data maintenance process flow enabled by a simple and easy to use interface to update data quickly and efficiently.*

## Design Principles

The design of  Human Services Data Specification is based on five principles: simplicity, factual, fidelity, provenance, and accessibility.

The underlying model is simple, consisting of four entities and associated properties that support who, what, where and when questions. The relationships between the entities are flexible and can model the majority of use cases for human services data. The goal is to build the simplest useful thing.

The data provided in the Human Services Data Specification are factual. This means that the information is verifiable and can be reproduced across different systems and applications.

Data fidelity is important. Data reproduced and used across different information systems must retain the same meaning and be represented in a consistent way. Implementing fidelity leverages the use of existing standards such as ISO time and date formats.

The standard must include information about the provenance of the data as well as a history of changes in order to provide an authoritative source. The standard supports column level metadata for a high degree of granularity.

The data must be a machine readable and writable format that can be created, updated and deleted with a basic text editor.

***

<a name="A Common Vocabulary">
### A Common Vocabulary

The Human Services Data Specification seeks to establish a common vocabulary among information and referral (I&R) practitioners. The vocabulary reflects the simple model of four required entities: Organizations, Locations, Services, and Metadata. An optional entity is Programs, which is available for organizations that use Programs for grouping Services.  Entities have attendant properties and some properties are complex and have multiple attributes. For example addresses are comprised of several pieces of information.. 

The relationship between organizations as the primary entity and services and locations as subordinate entities is loosely coupled in recognition that service providers may organize the data in different ways and that human services continue to evolve. For example, some services such as virtual support groups or informational websites may not have a physical location.

***

<a name="capabilities">
## Current Human Services Data Capabilities

The specification supports:

* Provisioning the minimum amount of data needed to implement a service for search and discovery of human services provided by organizations
* Machine readable format that can be imported directly into a relational database or viewed and edited using commonly available software such as a spreadsheet or a text editor
* A common data exchange format between different information and referral systems.

<a name="governance">
### Specification Governance

To promote participation and accessibility, this Google Document serves as the working draft of the next version of Human Services Data Specification.  Edits, improvements and changes should first be discussed using the Comments feature. 

#### Versions

Version 1.0 has been published. The workgroup is considering when it is appropriate to improve upon the specification while allowing appropriate time for data producers and consumers to reliably build upon the specification. 

This working document--and the [complementary Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plats-discussion)-- will continue to serve as a forum for discussion and feedback. These conversations will inform the future evolution of the specification.

## Section 2: Producing and Sharing Compliant Data 

<a name="csv">
### CSV Formatting

For ease of data production, Human Services Data Specification specifies that all files are provided in a simple comma-separated value format (.csv). The CSV format described herein conforms to [RFC4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180). Text will used the UTF-8 character set.

<a name="telephone">
### Telephone Formatting

HSDS uses[ E.164](http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164-201011-I/en) number formatting for phone numbers E.164 numbers can have a maximum of fifteen digits and are usually written as follows: [+][country code][subscriber number including area/region code]. Phone numbers can contain delimiters.

<a name="address">
### Address Formatting

At the time this document was drafted, a standard addressing format has not been established. ISO 19160  is in the preliminary stages of an addressing standard but has not yet produced a standard. Based on address standards by country from the Universal Postal Union,  the following format will capture the majority of addresses in use globally.

	address_1
	address_2
	address_3
	adderss_4
	city/locality
	state/province/region
	postal code
	country

Because of the variety of addressing systems, every field is composed of alphanumeric characters. The country field uses ISO-3166 alpha 2 codes.

<a name="description">
### Description Field Formatting

The description field may include HTML or MarkDown tags.

<a name="guidance">
### Guidance on Mapping Fields and Values

Source data may or may not map directly to the HSDS. Guidelines are listed below to reduce ambiguity.

* A null value is acceptable for required fields. 
* If there are no values for an entity, the corresponding CSV file can be omitted. 
* A data source may have a field that can map to an HSDS field but in many cases are not populated. A null value is acceptable.
* In some cases, such as name, using the organization name for either or both location or service is acceptable. This is up to the discretion of the data producer.
* Mapping a field is at the data producer’s discretion, but it is acceptable for some entities to map to multiple entities, for example an organization, service, or location can have a contact.
* The HSDS is a baseline of data, if the the data producer’s has additional fields or entities that they wish to add, the specification can be extended to incorporate them. The data producer should provide documentation of how the specification has been extended.

### Tabular Data Package

The data will be in CSV formatted files with one CSV file per entity. This is the minimum requirement for distributing data.  The recommended format for distributing data is the [Tabular Data Package](http://data.okfn.org/doc/tabular-data-package) which is composed of the data in CSV files and a metadata file, called datapackage.json, that stores the schema in a JSON file using the [Data Package format](http://data.okfn.org/doc/data-package).

A CSV file is required for each entity in the logical model. The files and their associated attributes are listed below.

The datapackage.json file contains general metadata such as the name of the package, date published, publisher, etc. It also includes a list of the CSV files included along with the schema. The data types used in the schema are defined in the [JSON Table Schema](http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema/).

The following is the schema for the logical data model in the datapackage.json file.

### Taxonomy

The Human Services Data Specification is agnostic with regards to taxonomy or any other method of classification or categorization of services. Data providers may have an existing taxonomy that they wish to include with their services data.  

Taxonomies are often hierarchical, such as AIRS.  A common way of representing hierarchy in relational databases and in flat files is [materialized paths](http://railsware.com/blog/2013/07/15/storing-tree-structures-in-the-rdbms/).  They are a very common pattern for flattening a hierarchical structure into list, for example the URL in a browser is a materialized path. Materialized paths stores each element in a full path all the way to the root element, e.g. ‘fruit.apple.golden delicious’. Because materialized paths are such a common pattern, many relational (Oracle, MS SQLServer, MySQL, Postgres  and nosql (MongoDB) databases implement it and provide a  domain specific language to handle hierarchical data.

The elements in the hierarchy are separated by periods or ".", e.g. ‘emergency.disaster_response’.
